# GardiPlan

## Description

A small garden planning app which allows to plan, track and comment harvesting years. 

### Planning harvests

The apps allows the plan how the garden will be organized by taking inputs on field size, growing bed size, number of rows, produce type and planting distances to be respected. After the first time of planting a crop, you can input the yield per harvest and produce type, which will auto calculate the potential averaged yield of the field.

### Monitoring the harvest

Make notes on different crops / produce planted, how did it grow, what were wheather conditions, diseases that occured, fertilization of the field, plowed or not etc. Make sure to weigh each harvest to allow planning how much should be planted to avoid over/under producing the crops.

## Future options

1. Freezer stock list with out of date warnings.
2. Connection to google agenda for seeding / planting seasons for the planned crops.
